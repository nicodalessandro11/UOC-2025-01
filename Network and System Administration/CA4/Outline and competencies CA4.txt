Due to the increasing complexity of business processes that we can encounter todayâ€™s enterprises, which require IT infrastructure to be able to execute, it is common for system administrators to face new technological challenges. These challenges often cannot be solved with the tools they regularly use. That is, one of the most important challenges for system administrators, and IT in general, is knowing what new technologies are emerging, selecting the most suitable one to solve a particular problem, and finally learning how to use it in a self-paced way.

Not having the skills and abilities to research new emerging technologies to select the most appropriate one to solve a problem would mean not being able to develop professionally, limiting options to promote.
