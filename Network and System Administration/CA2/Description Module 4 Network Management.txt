Description Module 4: Network Management
When designing and deploying a network, the following six basic steps must be taken into account:

Wire and hardware design selection.
Installation of network hardware and operating system.
Operating system configuration and application loading.
Creating the user environment.
Initialization of network management.
Maintenance and monitoring of network activity.
This module is intended to briefly address various aspects of the design and further development of a computer network. So, the module starts with a description of the elements that make it up and ends up defining, in a broad sense, the steps that need to be taken to connect a workstation to the network. It is not intended to make a comprehensive compilation of such a dense and heterogeneous subject matter but only to provide the administrator with some general criteria to help him start (and maintain) a task as complex as the one we described.
