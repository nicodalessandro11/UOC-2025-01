## Case Study

## üì±üöç Accessible Public Transport Apps üåç‚ôø

Nowadays, mobile public transport applications are key tools for planning routes, checking schedules, and ensuring efficient mobility. Examples like **Moovit, Citymapper, and Google Maps** allow millions of users to find real-time transport options. However, for people with **visual or motor disabilities**, these applications present challenges regarding **accessibility, usability, and customization**.

Some of the most common difficulties include the **lack of customizable options in the interface, unclear information about accessible routes, and intrusive notifications**. These barriers limit user confidence and experience when interacting with these applications, reducing their effectiveness and accessibility.

### How can we optimize the user experience in public transport applications to make them more inclusive, accessible, and valuable for people with visual or motor disabilities?

To address the challenges posed throughout the semester, you must use the provided application examples, as they are specifically designed for this type of service. **You must work only with the examples from this case study, as PECs based on other examples or cases will not be accepted.** Below are examples of public transport applications:

- **Moovit**: A platform that allows users to plan public transport routes.  
  **URL**: [https://moovitapp.com](https://moovitapp.com)  
  **Free version**: It includes essential features such as route planning and real-time schedules.

- **Citymapper**: Provides detailed multimodal route information with advanced options for public transport, cycling, and walking.  
  **URL**: [https://citymapper.com](https://citymapper.com)  
  **Free version**: Yes, it includes interactive maps and basic planning options.

- **Google Maps**: A tool with public transport information, directions, and interactive maps.  
  **URL**: [https://maps.google.com](https://maps.google.com)  
  **Free version**: It includes access to all main features.

## Project Development

Throughout the semester, the mentioned applications will be analyzed, and you will develop your **inclusive public transport application prototype**, applying **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), User-Centered Design (UCD), and Universal Design (UD) principles**. To effectively achieve this, consider the following **five requirements**:

1. **Interface Customization**: Allow accessibility adjustments such as **high-contrast mode, screen reader support, and text size adjustments** to enhance the experience for low-vision users.

2. **Accessible Route Planning**: Implement filters that prioritize **routes with accessible features**, such as **functional elevators and ramps**, while avoiding **paths that include stairs**.

3. **Interactive Navigation**: Provide **step-by-step navigation with multimodal options (visual, auditory, and haptic)** adapted to each user's capabilities.

4. **Configurable Alerts**: Offer **customizable notifications** to alert users about **route changes, out-of-service access points, and other relevant incidents** tailored to individual preferences.

5. **User Feedback**: Include a feature that allows users to **evaluate route accessibility and generate reports** that can be shared with authorities or developers for future improvements.

With these requirements in mind, your **accessible public transport application prototype** aims to **overcome the most common barriers** faced by users, particularly those with **accessibility needs**, when interacting with these platforms. By applying **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles**, the goal is to create an **optimized user experience** that ensures an **intuitive, efficient, and inclusive** design, facilitating **mobility and autonomy** for all users.

## Introduction for the assignment C1

### üìç RESEARCH

We have said that **User-Centered Design (UCD)** allows us to better understand users and design products and services that meet their needs. In this philosophy, it is necessary to involve the user in all stages of a product's development, from conceptualization to evaluation, including development.

The goal of UCD is to **create products that people find useful and usable**; that is, to meet their needs while taking into account their characteristics.

These stages or phases are a fundamental element of the process and help to plan, and especially to know what to do at each moment. Broadly speaking, we can consider that there are four fundamental stages in our UCD process:

1. **Research** ‚Äì Exploration of the Scenario
2. **Definition** ‚Äì Synthesis of the Proposal
3. **Generation** ‚Äì Implementation of a Low-Fidelity Prototype
4. **Evaluation** ‚Äì Testing and Validation of Prototyping with Users

These stages should not be seen as being delayed and successive; for each specific project, it will be necessary to plan, identify objectives, iterations, and methods to carry out.

In this first challenge, we will begin with the **Research** stage of our UCD methodology. In this phase, we must focus on the potential users of the [Case Study](#case-study)
:  
**Who are they? What are their goals, frustrations, and contexts of use?**

The research will include methods such as **user profile, benchmarking, and the basic concepts of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**.

### 1. User Profile

To design an interface, it is necessary to define the target audience that will use it, and this is achieved by selecting a set of characteristics that allow separating people into various groups. Initially, we establish the [**user profiles**](https://human-computer-interaction.aula.uoc.edu/user-profile/), but these can be expanded and detailed as the project progresses. In certain stages, this can be extremely valuable to guide and substantiate our design decisions focused on the selected profile.

Population segmentation or grouping is commonly done based on socio-demographic characteristics such as age and gender. In this challenge, you can consider other, more specific criteria that better reflect the needs and preferences of the users. Think about aspects such as **personal interests, level of technological skills, professional development, hobbies, or any other characteristic** that may reveal significant differences in user profiles.

üí° [**User profile example**](/images/user%20profile.png) ‚¨áÔ∏è.

### 2. Competition Research

The [**Benchmarking**](https://human-computer-interaction.aula.uoc.edu/benchmarking/) technique involves a detailed evaluation of the competing products that we are developing, but from the end-user's perspective. The main purpose is to **understand the strengths, distinctive features, and prevalent design trends** in the market we are targeting.

[**Benchmarking**](https://human-computer-interaction.aula.uoc.edu/benchmarking/) is not limited only to direct competitors. In fact, it can also be very revealing to analyze products that, although not directly competing with ours, offer similar functionalities. This **comparative approach** is an excellent starting point for identifying key elements that can significantly improve the user experience.

This technique is more than a simple comparison of features; it is a profound investigation that helps us understand **what works well in the market and why**. By conducting [**Benchmarking**](https://human-computer-interaction.aula.uoc.edu/benchmarking/), we not only identify what the competition is doing, but we also discover **opportunities to innovate and differentiate our product**. It is an essential step to ensure that our design is not only functional and attractive but also **competitive and relevant** in the current context.

### 3. Basic Aspects of Human-Computer Interaction

**HCI** is a field of study that focuses on the creation and design of interfaces between users and computer systems. In HCI, it's essential to understand basic concepts such as:

- [**Metaphor**](https://human-computer-interaction.aula.uoc.edu/metaphor/), which helps users relate the unknown (the digital interface) to familiar experiences from the real world.
- [**Affordance**](https://human-computer-interaction.aula.uoc.edu/affordance/), which refers to the characteristics of an object that suggest how it can be used.
- [**Visibility**](https://human-computer-interaction.aula.uoc.edu/visibility/), which involves the ease with which users can discern available functionalities.
- [**Feedback**](https://human-computer-interaction.aula.uoc.edu/feedback/), which provides users with immediate information about the actions they have performed.
- [**Constraint**](https://human-computer-interaction.aula.uoc.edu/constraint/), which limits the interactions that can be performed, preventing errors.
- [**Mental model**](https://human-computer-interaction.aula.uoc.edu/mental-model/), which represents how a user perceives and understands a system.

These concepts are crucial for designing interfaces that are **intuitive, efficient, and satisfying** for the user.

## Instructions for the assignment C1

### üìçRESEARCH

We begin this stage of our User-Centered Design (UCD) approach; our first step is to define **user profiles**. Next, using the **benchmarking** technique, we will analyze the applications of the [Case Study](#case-study). This analysis will allow us not only to understand the landscape of existing systems better but also to take the opportunity to delve into the **basic concepts of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**. This knowledge will guide us in designing a functional, attractive interface aligned with the needs and expectations of the users.

### 1. User Profile II

To design an interface, you must define the target audience that will use it, and this is achieved by selecting a set of characteristics that allow dividing people into various groups. Population segmentation is commonly based on sociodemographic factors such as age and gender. However, for this challenge, you can consider other more specific criteria that better reflect the needs and preferences of the users. Think about aspects such as personal interests, level of technological skills, professional development, hobbies, or any other characteristic that can reveal significant differences in user profiles.

üëâ **Define at least two (2)** [user profiles](https://human-computer-interaction.aula.uoc.edu/user-profile/) that represent the users in the context of the [Case Study](#case-study) we are analyzing. We will use these profiles throughout the course.

### 2. Competition Research II

To deepen the research, thoroughly analyze the **three (3) applications** indicated in the case study. When defining the analysis criteria, align them with the **five (5) requirements** described in the case study.

üëâ Apply the [**Benchmarking**](https://human-computer-interaction.aula.uoc.edu/benchmarking/) technique, identify **three (3) key positive elements** (insights) and **three (3) elements to avoid** in each analyzed application. This will result in **nine (9) positive insights** and **nine (9) elements to avoid**. These findings will be fundamental for conceptualising and developing your future prototype.

The main objective of this exercise is to understand **not only what functionalities current applications offer** but also to **identify areas for improvement**. Therefore, it is crucial that you closely observe both the strengths and weaknesses of these applications. To present your findings clearly and organise, create a comparison table summarising the results.

### 3. Basic Aspects of Human-Computer Interaction II

üëâ **Define and exemplify the six (6) basic HCI concepts**: [**metaphor**](https://human-computer-interaction.aula.uoc.edu/metaphor/), [**affordance**](https://human-computer-interaction.aula.uoc.edu/affordance/), [**visibility**](https://human-computer-interaction.aula.uoc.edu/visibility/), [**feedback**](https://human-computer-interaction.aula.uoc.edu/feedback/), [**constraint**](https://human-computer-interaction.aula.uoc.edu/constraint/) and [**mental model**](https://human-computer-interaction.aula.uoc.edu/mental-model/). Create a table, including the definition and practical examples from the **three (3) applications** you chose to illustrate these concepts. For each application example, include the following:

- **Application Name**: Provide the official name of the application.
- **URL**: Include the link to the application or its official page if available.
- **Screenshots**: Attach specific screenshots of the application that exemplify your concept.

Your analysis should be detailed, showing how each application demonstrates the HCI concept. This task is an opportunity to understand and identify the basic concepts of HCI in real examples of user interfaces.

### 4. Reflections II

üëâ As part of the **research phase closure**, it is essential to reflect on the **lessons learned** and how the activities have prepared you for the following stages of the project.
