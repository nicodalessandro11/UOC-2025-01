# Exercise 3: Collections in Kotlin

## (a) Data structure for car prices

For quick access to a car's price using its model name, we should use a HashMap. HashMap provides O(1) time complexity for lookups, which makes it the most efficient choice for this scenario.

```kotlin
// Creating a HashMap to store car models and their prices
val carPrices = HashMap<String, Int>()

// Adding a car with its price
carPrices["Ferrari Purosangue"] = 39835000

// Querying the price using the model name
val ferrariPrice = carPrices["Ferrari Purosangue"]
Log.d("CarPrice", "The Ferrari Purosangue costs $ferrariPrice")
```

## (b) List operations

```kotlin
// Creating a list of car names
val car_name_list = mutableListOf<String>()

// Adding 5 different items to the list
car_name_list.add("Ferrari")
car_name_list.add("Lamborghini")
car_name_list.add("Porsche")
car_name_list.add("Bugatti")
car_name_list.add("McLaren")

// Removing the string in the second position (index 1)
car_name_list.removeAt(1)

// Iterating through the list and printing each value
for (carName in car_name_list) {
    Log.d("debug", carName)
}
```

# Exercise 4: Classes in Kotlin

## (a) Car class

```kotlin
class Car(val name: String, val price: Int) {
    // The constructor parameters automatically become properties
    // because we used 'val' in the constructor
}
```

## (b) User class

```kotlin
class User(val id: Int) {
    // Username is nullable and initialized as null
    var username: String? = null
    
    // HashMap to store cars, with car name as the key
    val cars = HashMap<String, Car>()
}
```

## (c) Adding a car method

```kotlin
class User(val id: Int) {
    var username: String? = null
    val cars = HashMap<String, Car>()
    
    // Method to add a car to the HashMap
    fun addCar(d: Car) {
        cars[d.name] = d
    }
}
```

## (d) Removing a car method

```kotlin
class User(val id: Int) {
    var username: String? = null
    val cars = HashMap<String, Car>()
    
    fun addCar(d: Car) {
        cars[d.name] = d
    }
    
    // Method to remove a car from the HashMap using its name
    fun removeCar(d: String) {
        cars.remove(d)
    }
}
```

## (e) Why Int instead of Double for price

The price is declared as Int instead of Double because we're storing the price in the smallest currency unit (like cents or centavos). This avoids floating-point precision issues that can happen with Double when dealing with money calculations. 

For example, a price of $398,350.00 would be stored as 39835000 (in cents), which is more accurate for calculations than using a Double. When we need to display the price to users, we can convert it back to a decimal representation.

# Exercise 5: Use classes

In this exercise, we'll use the classes we created in Exercise 4 within the MainActivity.

```kotlin
// Inside the onCreate method of MainActivity

// (a) Create a User with id 18
val user = User(18)

// (b) Create a Car with name "Ferrari Purosangue" and price 39835000
val ferrari = Car("Ferrari Purosangue", 39835000)

// (c) Add the Car to the information about the user
user.addCar(ferrari)

// We can verify the car was added
Log.d("UserCars", "User has ${user.cars.size} cars")
Log.d("UserCars", "Ferrari price: ${user.cars["Ferrari Purosangue"]?.price}")

// (d) Remove the previous Car from the information about the user
user.removeCar("Ferrari Purosangue")

// We can verify the car was removed
Log.d("UserCars", "User has ${user.cars.size} cars after removal")
```

This code demonstrates creating a User object, creating a Car object, adding the car to the user's collection, and then removing it. The Log statements help verify that the operations were performed correctly.
