    üóÉÔ∏è DB | 2025-04-16 | Added PostGIS schema fixes and point features loader

    - Updated  to fix SECURITY DEFINER view issue and apply correct RLS policies
    - Fixed  to create  without the SECURITY DEFINER flag
    - Added new script  under  to handle ETL of cultural equipment
    - Adjusted  and  to support the new point features pipeline
    - Updated  with initial values for  (libraries, museums, etc.)

    Linter errors on Supabase dashboard are resolved and ETL for Barcelona point features is now operational.

    üóÉÔ∏è DB | 2025-04-15 | Added city_id to geographical_unit_view for clarity

    - Updated database/views.sql to include `city_id` in all levels of geographical_unit_view
    - Enables disambiguation of neighbourhood and district codes across different cities
    - Facilitates clearer joins and lookups in future ETLs (e.g. point_features, indicators)

    This change improves data traceability across geo levels and supports multi-city datasets more reliably.

    üóÉÔ∏è DB | 2025-04-15 | Normalize geo code fields and fix geographical view

    - Updated all ETL scripts to store  and  as integers
    - Aligned database schema to define  and  as INTEGER types

    - Ensures compatibility for future joins in ETLs for indicators and point_features using (geo_level_id, code)

    This change standardizes geo code fields across the DB and ETL to prevent type mismatch errors.

    ‚ôªÔ∏è Refactor | 2025-04-15 | Separated ETL and upload stages for districts and neighbourhoods

    - Refactored ingest_data.py to ensure districts are loaded and uploaded before neighbourhood ETL begins
    - Updated upload_to_supabase.py to split upload functions into run_district_upload and run_neighbourhood_upload
    - Replaced hardcoded district_id mappings in Madrid and Barcelona neighbourhood scripts with dynamic lookup from Supabase
    - Improved script reliability by removing assumptions on auto-increment IDs and ensuring valid foreign key relationships

    This change ensures consistent ETL pipeline execution and eliminates dependency errors during neighbourhood uploads.

    üõ†Ô∏è Setup | 2025-04-15 | Refactored Makefile with modular test commands

    - Added separate targets for test_processed and test_geometry under test suite
    - Clarified comments for each command including etl, clean, upload, and seed
    - Enables isolated test runs and better developer experience during debugging

    This update improves maintainability and transparency in running parts of the pipeline independently.

    üì¶ Feature | 2025-04-15 | Added ETL scripts and processed data for BCN & Madrid

    - Created `load_districts.py` and `load_neighbourhoods.py` for both Barcelona and Madrid under `data/scripts/`
    - Generated `insert_ready_*.json` files with cleaned and WKT-wrapped geometries in `data/processed/`
    - Ensured all districts and neighbourhoods are standardized and mapped to city IDs
    - Added seed.sql to initialize PostGIS schema with all required tables and constraints
    - Added `test_geometry_integrity.py` to validate WKT consistency between raw and processed files
    - Includes Makefile commands (`etl`, `test`) for pipeline reproducibility

    Enables complete ETL and test pipeline for loading and validating geospatial data per city.
