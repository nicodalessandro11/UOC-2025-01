**# Final Project Plan: Are U Query-ous?**

## **1. Scope**

### **1.1 High-Level Description**
The project "Are U Query-ous?" is a web-based **geo-analytics** application designed to make **open data more accessible and insightful** for businesses, marketers, and researchers. The platform will allow users to interact with **geospatial datasets**, visualize **location-based trends**, and filter insights through **an interactive map**. The system will also integrate **AI-powered natural language queries** to make data retrieval intuitive.

### **1.2 Requirements and Features**
The application will consist of the following core features:
✅ **Dynamic Map Visualizations**: Users can explore open data via interactive maps using **Leaflet.js** and React.
✅ **Geospatial Data Filtering**: Users can filter locations based on criteria such as **business category, population density, and income levels**.
✅ **AI Query Processing (Optional Feature)**: A natural language interface that allows users to ask business-related geo-queries (e.g., "Where is the best area to open a coffee shop?").
✅ **Custom Polygon Rendering**: The system will display high-income and high-traffic zones based on **open data sources**.
✅ **Real-Time Data Fetching**: The platform will fetch **open datasets** from sources like **Barcelona Open Data, INE (Instituto Nacional de Estadística), and OpenStreetMap (OSM)**.

### **1.3 Complexity and Realism**
This project is designed to **test full-stack development skills** (React, FastAPI, PostgreSQL/PostGIS) while remaining **achievable within one semester**. The scope balances complexity with feasibility, ensuring that key functionalities (data visualization, filtering, API integration) can be developed and tested effectively.

## **2. Technology Stack**

### **Frontend**
- **React.js + Leaflet.js**: For rendering the interactive map and user interface.
- **Axios**: For making API requests to fetch geo-data.

### **Backend**
- **FastAPI (Python)**: API for serving geospatial data.
- **PostgreSQL + PostGIS**: Storing and managing geospatial data.
- **Docker**: Containerization for database and backend services.

### **Data Sources**
- **Barcelona Open Data**: Foot traffic, demographic, and economic data.
- **INE Spain**: Population density and socio-economic indicators.
- **OpenStreetMap**: Business locations and street data.

### **Deployment & Development Tools**
- **GitHub Codespaces**: Cloud-based development environment.
- **Vercel (Frontend)** / **Render (Backend)**: Free hosting for deployment.
- **Docker Compose**: Managing database and API services.
